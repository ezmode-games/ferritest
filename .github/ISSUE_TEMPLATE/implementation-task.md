## Goal

**Single, focused objective this task achieves.**

## Exact Implementation Requirements

### Required Struct/Trait Structure
```rust
// Exact struct definitions, trait signatures, or API expected
```

### Behavior Requirements
- Specific requirement 1 with clear success criteria
- Specific requirement 2 with measurable outcome
- Specific requirement 3 with validation method

### Error Handling
- What errors to return and when
- Required error types and messages
- Recovery strategies if applicable

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Tests Required
```rust
#[test]
fn test_expected_behavior() {
    // Exact test cases that must pass
    // Include setup, execution, and assertions
    assert_eq!(result, expected_value);
}

#[test]
#[should_panic(expected = "specific error")]
fn test_error_case() {
    // Error condition tests
}
```

### Performance Requirements
- Specific performance metrics if applicable
- Memory usage constraints if relevant
- Algorithmic complexity requirements if needed

### Rust Requirements
- All types must be explicit (no unnecessary inference)
- Proper use of Result<T, E> for fallible operations
- No `unwrap()` in production code (except where logically impossible to fail)
- Must pass `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
- Must pass `cargo fmt -- --check`

## What NOT to Include

- Feature 1 that's out of scope (separate issue)
- Feature 2 that's not needed yet (future consideration)
- Complex feature that should be broken down further

## File Locations

- Implementation: `src/module_name.rs`
- Tests: Bottom of same file in `#[cfg(test)]` module
- Re-export from: `src/main.rs` or `src/lib.rs`

## Integration Requirements

### Dependencies
- Required crates or modules
- Integration points with existing code
- Compatibility requirements

### Usage Examples
```rust
// Concrete examples of how this will be used
let tester = CpuTester::new();
let result = tester.run_tests(&config)?;
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All functional tests pass
- [ ] `cargo test` passes
- [ ] `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` passes
- [ ] `cargo fmt -- --check` passes
- [ ] No `unsafe` code (project policy)
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] No emoji in code, comments, or documentation
- [ ] Exports added to module files

**This issue is complete when:** [Specific, measurable completion condition]
